1) The following command adds a path to your current path:
export PATH=$PATH:/my/custom/path


2) If you want your setup to execute this command every time,

   When you login, the following scripts will be executed in this order:

/etc/profile      (which starts by loading everything in /etc/profile.d)
~/.profile        (which starts by loading ~/.bashrc if you are running bash)

3) Printing $PATH content
echo $PATH
